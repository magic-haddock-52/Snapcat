An App designed to record sightings of the University of Essex's "Campus Cat" (aka Pebbles). My rationale behind the app was to increase engagement, something I found lacking in the aftermath of COVID, and to make something fun and a bit silly.

Developed as part of my CE881: Mobile and Social Application Programming coursework (originally designed for my CE301: Capstone Project). 

Rewritten to iron out any issues.
